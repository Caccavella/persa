They see the world in radically unique ways. They are known for their incredible discernment, premonitions, intuition, and inspiration. Metaphysicists are among the deepest of thinkers. They welcome the complexities of life and are drawn to perplexing topics. Metaphysisists will often have a passion for esoteric topics like psychology, philosophy, theology, spirituality, ancient history, the supernatural, and other mystical fields of interest. They are expert pattern recognizers who see things that others can’t. As the name implies they’re truly focused on metaphysics, or the field of understanding our perceptions of reality, the relationships between the mind and the external world, and discovering hidden truths. They frequently imagine life as it exists in different times and places. They are frequently off in a different world and may have a hard time adjusting to the realities of current life. They truly are one of a kind. Metaphysicists function in ways that are alien or dramatically different from most people. They often coalesce disparate ideas together in ways that other people would never do. They love to entertain new ideas and see if it could be true. Unlike most introspective leaning types, Metaphysicists easily get to conclusions and don’t dabble away thinking about every last possibility. They’re more focused on what is actually out there as opposed to imaginary situations. However, like most highly imaginative and intuitive people, Metaphysicists are drawn to archetypes. They are excellent symbologists and many of them make fantastic linguists and anthropologists as well. They know where ideas come from and comprehend how they’re used in society. They’re never really here in the present moment, however they see their detachment from societal wisdom as a blessing. They understand the inherent flaws of others' presentism, groupthink, and memetic thinking. Metaphysicists prefer to take a dioramic view of thoughts, ideas, and practices over time as opposed to current year thinking. They are quite comfortable with cognitive dissonance and can understand the paradoxes of life. We would be at a much lower standard of intellectual thought and curiosity without their significant contributions."},

They are intimately connected to the part of their being that just knows. Intuitives are highly perceptive people who see ideas, patterns, vibes, and paradigms that others have an incredibly hard time seeing. They are extremely multidimensional processors who almost develop a 6th sense or a premonition for things. They are very aware and connected to their subconscious thoughts. Most of them are quite empathic and can easily feel the emotions of others. Intuitives are often quite sensitive individuals who are very susceptible to the judgments, desires, and moods of others. Most of them are quite introverted as well and need time to recharge from the energy of others. The deep perceptions of Intuitives come naturally to them as they are very connected to the world of introspection. Many Intuitives are frequent day dreamers with incredible imaginations. Intuitives are often attracted to the fields of art, literature, poetry, mythology, psychology, and acting. Intuitives are very tied to their own feelings and usually have a strong desire to be unique. Intuitives want to be able to stand out through their own inherent individuality. Intutives easily see multiple viewpoints and prefer to say that there are multiple right answers. They can be quite relativistic or in their thinking meaning that everyone has their own truth that can be different from someone else’s. Some of them are even quite solipsistic and believe that the whole idea that knowledge is subjective and that there is no way to know objective truths. Needless to say, they are very fluid in their thinking and don’t like ideas to be put into strict boxes. While most people can develop concrete or conventional intuition (ability to read the energy around you), Intuitives usually develop abstract intuition that helps them explore and explain profoundly deep ideas related to philosophy, theology, metaphysics, or the supernatural. Intuitives believe that everything is somehow connected and that all of our choices have important consequences. Most of them are drawn to the ideas related to destiny or karma. Our world would be an extraordinarily dull place without their actions, ideas, or presence."},

Divergents are inherently good at divergent thinking, meaning that they are able to have more different possibilities in their head than the other Neuro Types. Most Divergents are both exceptionally creative yet remarkably analytical. They truly are outside the box thinkers who are quickly able to see things differently from those around them. Most of them are highly intelligent individuals who can quickly find solutions to abstract problems. They are extremely expansive in their thinking and are always able to take multiple perspectives and factors into consideration. Most of them are very non-judgmental people who understand the complexities and nuances of life. As expert brainstormers, they frequently help others see new concepts, designs, and opinions relating to different situations. They expand people’s world. As impressively innovative analyzers, they are always able to connect disparate ideas. This means that they see connections, correlations, and relationships between seemingly unrelated phenomena. There’s always a new hypothesis for the Divergent. This allows them to explore ideas in unique ways. Most Divergents are drawn heavily to media, whether as simple entertainment, or as a producer of content. They often have fantastic advice for other people being able to see opportunities for others that they can’t see themselves. For Divergents, the world is a beautifully chaotic place with so many random variables. However, the randomness of life allows for exciting change, growth, and exploration. Divergents frequently will seek new opportunities that will make their lives more interesting. Their experiences give them great knowledge of the world and helps them understand different ways it could be. Everyone would have a lot less avenues open to them without the powerful minds of the Divergents."},

People can change and no one is set in stone. People should give everyone the right to self-determination. Pragmatists often believe that the use and development of personal agency leads to the greatest results. Things should be kept objectively simple for people to grow and accomplish their goals. Every society is much further along in its progress from the thoughts and actions of Pragmatists."},

Substantials are also great users of deductive reasoning and can quickly get to a coherent point or conclusion. Substantials are very much focused on the consequences of their and other people’s actions. For this reason many of them are drawn to ethics and philosophy. While other people get bogged down by theories, emotions, data, and other circumstantial pieces of information, Substantials are always looking at what might actually happen after all is said and done. They are broad leveled, multi-layered thinkers who enjoy seeing phenomena that others can’t. They are adept at seeing patterns and can clearly view what’s important and what’s trivial. They view themselves as being intellectually honest, mature, and unbiased. People frequently rely on their  guiding advice, sage judgement, and insightful strategies.

This means that they find joy in instructing others in their ideas. This is why many of them are drawn to academia, writing books, and creating content for others to see. They’re not just in Universities, but all over YouTube, Reddit, and other Social Media Platforms. The Internet is a heaven of ideas for Theorists. Theorists are very incorporeal individuals who rely on their intuition more than their sensory experiences. They prefer to think about non concrete forms as opposed to real life situations. They love to narrate stories that convey as much information as possible. The narrative is paramount to the Theorist. All of these traits can leave Theorists detached from society and real world experience. However, Theorists view their intellectual abilities as an important way to be more logical.
